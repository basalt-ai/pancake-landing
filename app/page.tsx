     Description = this landing's hero H2 (its SERP line from 2026-08-18 to
     2026-08-31), restored 2026-09-02 on the founder's word ("on a eu des H2
     différents avant sur cette landing page, il faut le remettre") after a
     revert had swapped in the July v1 copy ("AI coworker in Slack, $49/
     month" — wrong positioning, wrong price). Known trade-off: with a
     one-word <title>, Google may build its own title from other signals
     (it showed "Pancake's AI" once); the og/twitter titles and the JSON-LD
     names carry the full "Pancake — You run your company. We bring you
     customers." so it has a coherent descriptive title to pick instead. */
