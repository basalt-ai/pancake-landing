              Pancake is operated by Basalt AI Inc., 535 Mission St, San Francisco, CA 94105,
              USA. As part of its activities, Pancake may process personal data. We attach the
              utmost importance to the security and confidentiality of user data, whether
              collected via our website (
              <a href="https://getpancake.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                https://getpancake.ai

            <p>
              In some cases, Pancake may receive data from Slack (such as event payloads or
              system logs) that is <strong>not actively used</strong>.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This data is <strong>not processed beyond what is necessary for system operation</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                It is <strong>not stored long-term</strong> and is automatically deleted

            </ul>

            <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>

              </li>
              <li>
                Slack data: retained only as needed to provide the service and may be deleted

            <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
            <p>
              We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal

            </p>
            <p>Data is hosted on GCP infrastructure located in the United States.</p>

            <h2>8. Google User Data</h2>
            <p>
              Pancake integrates with Google Workspace to act as a cofounder for our users. With

            <h3>How we use Google user data</h3>
            <p>
              Google user data is used <strong>solely to provide and improve the user-facing
              features of Pancake</strong> — specifically, to let our AI cofounder read, draft,
              schedule, and edit on your behalf in response to your instructions. Google user
              data is not used for any other purpose.
            </p>

            <h3>How we share Google user data</h3>
            <p>
              Google user data is processed by a single sub-processor:{" "}
              <strong>Anthropic, PBC</strong>, the provider of the large language model that
              powers Pancake&apos;s reasoning. Anthropic processes the data only to generate
              responses for Pancake and, per its commercial terms, does not retain prompts or
              completions beyond what is necessary to provide the service and does not use them
              to train its models. We do not share Google user data with any other third party.
            </p>

            <h3>How we protect Google user data</h3>
            <p>
              Google user data is encrypted in transit using TLS/SSL and at rest using AES-256.
              Access is restricted to authorized personnel via SSO and is logged and audited.
              OAuth tokens are stored in an encrypted secrets store.
            </p>

            <h3>How we retain and delete Google user data</h3>
            <p>
              Google user data fetched to fulfill a user request is retained for{" "}
              <strong>up to 14 days</strong> and then automatically deleted. You can revoke
              Pancake&apos;s access at any time from your Google Account&apos;s{" "}

              page, or by emailing{" "}
              <a href="mailto:privacy@pancake.ai">privacy@pancake.ai</a>. On revocation or
              account deletion, all stored Google user data is deleted within 14 days, except
              where retention is required by law.
            </p>

            <h3>What we do not do with Google user data</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell Google user data.</li>
              <li>
                We do <strong>not</strong> use Google user data for advertising, including
                personalized, retargeted, or interest-based advertising.
              </li>
              <li>
                We do <strong>not</strong> transfer Google user data to data brokers, or for
                credit-worthiness or lending purposes.
              </li>
              <li>
                We do <strong>not</strong> use Google user data to develop, improve, or train
                generalized or non-personalized AI/ML models. Anthropic, our model provider,
                does not train its models on Pancake customer data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Humans do not read Google user data except (a) with your explicit permission,
                (b) for security purposes (e.g., investigating abuse), (c) to comply with
                applicable law, or (d) where the data has been aggregated and anonymized for
                internal operations.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Limited Use disclosure</h3>
            <p>
              Pancake&apos;s use and transfer to any other app of information received from
              Google APIs will adhere to the{" "}
              <a
                href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy"
                target="_blank"

              , including the Limited Use requirements.
            </p>

            <h2>9. AI Agent and Connector Integrations</h2>
            <p>
              You can connect a supported AI client, such as ChatGPT, Codex, or Claude, to one
              Pancake workspace. The client sends specific tool requests to Pancake after you
              sign in, choose the workspace, and approve access.
            </p>
            <h3>Data sent to your AI client</h3>
            <p>
              Pancake returns only the workspace data needed for the tool you or the client
              invokes. The client may use that data to answer your prompt. Data sent to the
              client is then processed under that provider&apos;s own terms and privacy policy.
              Pancake does not receive your full third-party chat transcript unless the client
              includes part of it in a tool request.
            </p>
            <h3>Connection security and control</h3>
            <p>
              Each connection uses OAuth and is limited to the workspace you approve. Access
              and refresh tokens are stored only as one-way hashes. You can revoke a connection
              in Pancake under Settings → MCP → Connected clients.
            </p>
            <h3>Retention</h3>
            <p>
              Pancake keeps non-secret connection metadata while the grant remains active. Any
              feedback or workspace change made through a connected client is retained like the
              same change made in the Pancake web app. Pancake does not create a separate copy of
              your third-party conversation solely because you use the connector.
            </p>
