// Testimonials — "Take it from them" (Figma node 4257:5006, reworked 2026-08-28
// per founder direction: distinct tweets per row, counter-scrolling marquees).
// Two strips of 4 distinct X-post cards each — row 1 scrolls left, row 2 right.
// Each strip's track holds its 4-card set twice (duplicate aria-hidden) and
// slides exactly one set width (2300px) per loop, so the wrap is seamless.
// Double spaces in the row-1 bodies are verbatim from Figma (pre-wrap).
// ≤767 the strips are display:none and .lp-tst-carousel below takes over: all
// 8 tweets once (no marquee duplicates) in a horizontal scroll-snap carousel
// (founder 2026-08-31: smaller cards, horizontal swipe instead of tall stack).
