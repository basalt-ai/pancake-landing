 * Landing v3 — section 6 "How Pancake finds customers" (Figma 4257:4976,
 * rev2 artboard 1654×2969). Heading + 4 feature cards (1296×621) + 4 hairline
 * separators. Each card's mock UI is an animation (founder 2026-09-02:
 * "animate the four buckets, fully derived from the designer's picture, the
 * picture is the final screen") — rendered IN PLACE as DOM + CSS + GSAP since
 * 2026-09-03 (founder: no video downloads, vector-based), the same markup,
 * geometry and choreography as the pancake-studio compositions that used to
 * be served as mp4s (LpFeatMocks.tsx, features.css, lp-feat-timelines.ts).
 * LpFeatAnim plays each once when its card comes into view and holds the
 * designer's picture as the last frame.
