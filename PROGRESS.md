## Human / agent toggle foundation — September 4, 2026

Scope: original human landing plus a selector above the headline’s right edge. Agent mode keeps the hero layout and uses inverse cream/plum colors, followed by the agent terminal playground requested in the subsequent iteration.

- [x] Restore original v3 copy and section components.
- [x] Keep human layout unchanged apart from the selector.
- [x] Match the Figma Signals switch, with rainbow blue for humans and green for agents.
- [x] Remove the earlier agent copy, demonstrations and setup surfaces.
- [x] Add the inverse hero, preserving artwork and motion phase.
- [x] Keep URL sharing, refresh, browser history and keyboard switching working.
- [x] Add a quick 240ms crossfade in both directions, respecting reduced motion.
- [x] Remove the pre-fade wait and keep the switch’s standard slide outside the page crossfade.
- [x] Set the agent H1 to “Give your human” / “GTM superpowers”, preserving the original font, size and headline box.
- [x] Add the agent-only “Start here” terminal CTA with verified public plugin setup URL and working copy feedback.
- [x] Set the terminal background to pure black; remove “Start here” at the founder’s request.
- [x] Add the single-line `> give your human gtm superpowers` Aeonik Fono agent headline, with a typing reveal followed by a continuously blinking cursor; reduced motion shows the complete line and solid cursor immediately.
- [x] Set a balanced agent headline size and remove the initial size jump; begin typing after fonts settle, preserving human layout and setup alignment.
- [x] Align the agent setup block to the original human description/buttons bounds, preserving their position and width on desktop and mobile.
- [x] Replace the paste hint with “friends with” and white Claude / Codex / Cursor / Hermes / OpenClaw logos above the terminal at its right edge, preserving accessible copy feedback.
- [x] Center the desktop terminal on the H1, tighten the lowercase friends row to a 12px gap, and remove the Hermes portrait’s border and backing.
- [x] Compare desktop and phone human layouts against baseline `14ad159`.
- [x] Independently review code and test booking and mobile menu behavior.
- [x] Complete production build and updated Vercel preview verification.

## Agent terminal playground — September 4, 2026

- [x] Replace the empty agent viewport with a continuously generated GTM pseudocode terminal.
- [x] Use Pretext for actual line reflow around the pointer, with cached text metrics and bounded canvas rendering.
- [x] Add a deliberately impossible paired-tile puzzle, then simplify its presentation to the founder’s classic CAPTCHA reference.
- [x] Keep the title and instruction on separate single lines, each with uniform text size.
- [x] Support keyboard interaction, live feedback, pause/resume, reduced motion and native touch scrolling.
- [x] Exhaustively verify the puzzle’s parity invariant and independently review accessibility and human-mode isolation.
